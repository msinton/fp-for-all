### Scala Excercises

To make the exercises have a low barrier to entry, they are written as *scala scripts*, and/or in *Jupyter notebooks*.

#### Jupyter notebooks
Upload the given file into the notebook:

For scala supported notebooks go to:
https://almond.sh/

Then simply upload the notebook file e.g. "map2-ex.ipynb"

#### Scala scripts
There are 2 requirements
 - Java
 - Scala

Then to get started just choose the exercise and in your terminal run

        sudo ./scripts/shell.sh map2.sc

This will execute and watch `map2.sc`
Complete the exercises directly in the file `map2.sc` and watch the ouput
